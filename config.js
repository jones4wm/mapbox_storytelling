    description: `Throughout both of their novels Hurston and Walker showcase female empowerment through both movement and economic purchases. There are a lot more instances of movement and economic purchases by women in these novels than there is in As I Lay Dying. Through both the text and the mapping data we will show how Hurston and Walker show a more positive vision of the south than Faulkner. Hurston and Walker mainly show a more positive vision of the south by showing how women empower themselves through movement and economics even in dire times. Ward also shows female empowerment but her work is more focused on the personal than the economic.`,

    title: 'Hurston: Empowerment Through Movement and Economics',
    image: './assets/their_eyes_were_watching_god.jpg',
    description: `Throughout *Their Eyes Were Watching God* we see Janie’s empowerment through movement in particular. First, she runs away from her first husband. Then one day she meets Tea Cake and they do business together.

Some may critique this novel because they see Janie as finding her identity through men. While this may be true to some degree, what makes Janie empowered in this situation is that she is with Tea Cake on her own terms.

Here is one instance of Janie doing business with Tea Cake: “Tea Cake and Janie decided to stay since they wanted to make another season on the muck. There was nothing to do, after they had gathered several bushels of dried beans to save over and sell to the planters in the fall.” (Hurston 139)

An important takeaway from this passage is how it shows Janie doing business on her own terms. Earlier in the novel she had been working at the store but it was not something she wanted to do—it was forced on her by her husband Jody.

At one point Tea Cake is being irresponsible by gambling away all the money. At this point in the novel Janie takes matters into her own hands: “Tea Cake was spending and doing out his own pocket, so Janie never told him about the two hundred dollars she had pinned inside her shirt next to her skin.” (Hurston 117)

This is one of the ways Hurston shows empowerment even in less than ideal circumstances—Janie is taking control of her money to forge her own path.

    description: `Walker’s novel places more emphasis on economic empowerment than Hurston’s. Celie moves to Tennessee and starts her pants business with Shug’s help:

“Then finally one day I made the perfect pair of pants. For my sugar, naturally. They soft dark blue jersey with teeny patches of red. But what makes them so good is, they totally comfortable.” (Walker 211)

“She laugh. ‘Let’s us put advertisements in the paper,’ she say. ‘And let’s us raise your prices a hefty notch. And let’s us just go ahead and give you this dining room for your factory and git you some more women in here to cut and sew, while you sit back and design. You making your living, Celie,’ she say. ‘Girl, you on your way.’” (Walker 213)

With Shug supporting Celie, Walker shows how female empowerment can be a collective journey, not just a solitary one.

    title: 'As I Lay Dying vs Salvage the Bones',
    image: './assets/salvage_the_bones.jpg',
    description: `While *As I Lay Dying* includes examples of economic purchases made by women, these moments are portrayed through the male gaze and lack the empowering context seen in other works. In contrast, *Salvage the Bones* features little in the way of economic activity, but instead emphasizes female empowerment through personal growth—particularly in Esch’s stand against Manny.

> "All right," he says, going away. "She looks pretty good for a country girl," he says.  
> "Wait," I says. He waited and I went and peeped through the crack. But I couldn't tell nothing except she had a good leg against the light. "Is she young you say?" I says. (Faulkner 242)

> "I gave her the box of capsules. She held the box in her hand, looking at the capsules.  
> 'Are you sure it'll work?' she says.  
> 'Sure,' I says. 'When you take the rest of the treatment.'  
> 'Where do I take it?' she says.  
> 'Down in the cellar,' I says." (Faulkner 248)

Despite allowing women the agency to make purchases, Faulkner often depicts them as victims of a patriarchal and exploitative society. In one disturbing scene, a man named MacGowan impersonates a pharmacist to give a young woman a box of pills, claiming it is abortion medication, and insists she must follow up "down in the cellar"—a moment laden with implications of abuse.

Faulkner uses these examples not to uplift female characters, but to critique the deeply embedded misogyny and social decay in Southern life. In contrast, Ward’s *Salvage the Bones* portrays empowerment through emotional resilience, suggesting a more personal but nonetheless powerful form of agency.

                One reason may be that being a white man may paradoxically make Faulkner more inclined to write a negative depiction of the South.
                Hurston, Walker, and Ward more often portray how Black women empower themselves—even in dire circumstances—
                suggesting a more hopeful or resistant narrative than Faulkner offers.

    description: `In Hurston’s *Their Eyes Were Watching God*, there are five recorded economic purchases by men and four by women. Although the number for women is slightly lower, it represents a significant leap compared to Faulkner’s *As I Lay Dying*, which features only one.

These purchases are distributed across various parts of Florida, including Lake City, Orlando, and West Palm Beach. This geographical spread highlights not only women's economic engagement but also their freedom of movement. As Janie journeys through these locations, each purchase underscores her growing independence and agency—central to Hurston’s portrayal of female empowerment.

    description: `In *The Color Purple*, there are ten purchases by women and only four by men. This novel most clearly illustrates how women gain freedom through economics and movement—especially Celie, who relocates from Georgia to Memphis, Tennessee.

Celie’s journey toward independence is symbolized by her move and the creation of her own business. As shown in earlier quotes, she is not only able to support herself but thrives economically, emphasizing Walker’s theme of female empowerment through financial and geographic mobility.

    description: `In *As I Lay Dying*, there is only one purchase made by a woman, compared to six made by men. This disparity reflects Faulkner’s more cynical portrayal of the South and the limited roles women are allowed to occupy within it.

Even the single purchase by a woman is shown through a male perspective and is framed negatively—it involves buying abortion medication. Women in Faulkner's narrative are rarely granted economic agency, and when they do engage with the economy, it is depicted as a response to desperation rather than empowerment.

    title: 'Data Analysis for Salvage the Bones',
    image: './assets/salvage_the_bones.jpg',
    description: `In *Salvage the Bones*, there are three total instances of women partaking in economic activity—significantly more than in Faulkner's *As I Lay Dying*. This contrast highlights Faulkner’s more negative portrayal of the South. 

Despite the harsh conditions in Jesmyn Ward’s novel, female characters still manage to make purchases and move with some freedom. More importantly, they are granted social agency, standing up for themselves in the face of oppression and mistreatment. However, many of these economic actions take the form of theft rather than formal exchange, reflecting the extreme poverty of their environment.

This suggests that Ward sees possibility and empowerment even under dire circumstances. The women in the novel are resilient and resourceful, solving problems on their own terms rather than relying on men, portraying a more hopeful and dynamic view of the South.

    description: `Our main takeaway from the data—especially when examining the works of Hurston and Walker—is that they offer a more hopeful and empowering view of the South. While their characters face significant hardships, both Hurston’s and Walker’s protagonists ultimately emerge stronger and more independent by the end of their respective stories.

Although the data can’t fully capture the emotional depth or complexity of these journeys, it does provide a visual representation of the freedom and agency their characters demonstrate—particularly in terms of movement and economic independence. This stands in stark contrast to Faulkner’s darker, more cynical depiction of the South. Ward also portrays female empowerment, though her focus is more personal than economic, distinguishing her approach from Hurston’s and Walker’s.
